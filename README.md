# Network Flow Guard (NFG) for Rogue Access Point (RAP) Detection

This project utilizes Ryuretic, a modular programming language for Ryu, to implement a Software Defined Networking (SDN) solution for detecting and preventing Rogue Access Points, such as Wireless APs and Wireless Routers implementing Network Address Translation (NAT) connected to an OpenFlow enabled Switch.
