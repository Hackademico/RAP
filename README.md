# Network Flow Guard (NFG) for Rogue Access Point (RAP) Detection

This project utilizes Ryuretic, a modular programming language for Ryu, to implement a Software Defined Networking (SDN) solution for detecting and preventing Rogue Access Points, such as Wireless APs and Wireless Routers implementing Network Address Translation (NAT) connected to an OpenFlow enabled Switch. 

In this project, we use Mininet-WiFi to emulate both legitimate traffic from authorized hosts and the illegitimate, wireless traffic created by rogue devices.
